## Description
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a>

This is a README.md file generator, a tool to help you create professional README files for your projects.

### Motivation
The motivation behind creating this project was to simplify the process of generating high-quality README files for GitHub repositories. A well-documented README is essential for open-source projects, and it can be time-consuming to create one manually. This tool automates the process and allows developers to focus on building their projects.

### Why I Built This
I built this project because I noticed that many developers struggle with creating informative and consistent README files. I wanted to provide a solution that simplifies this task and ensures that every project has a clear and structured README.

### Problem Solved
This project solves the problem of manual README creation. It streamlines the process and provides a template that includes all the essential sections, making it easier for developers to showcase their work.

### What I Learned
While developing this project, I learned more about Node.js, JavaScript, and how to create command-line tools. I also gained a better understanding of Markdown and how to structure documentation effectively.

The README Generator will start and prompt you to answer a series of questions to customize your README file.
